Left Center Right (LCR) is a turn based, dice game that requires three or more
players. Players should determine the order in which they will take turns. At 
the start of the game, each player is given three chips of equal value.

On a players turn, the player will roll up to three dice. If the player has 
less than three chips, the player can only roll the number of dice equal to the
number of chips they have. Note, a player is still in the game if they have no
chips.

The dice are six sided, with three sides marked L, C, R, and the rest marked 
with a dot. After the player rolls the dice, they will take actions based on 
the dice as follows:
- For each L, the player must pass one chip to the player sitting to the left.
- For each R, the player must pass one chip to the player sitting to the right.
- For each C, the player must place one chip into the center pot and those
  chips are now out of play.
- Dots are neutral and require no action to be taken for that die.

The winner is the last player with chips.
